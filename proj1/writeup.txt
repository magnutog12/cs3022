Compiled with g++ -o lib_info lib_info.cpp
Summary: Magnus handled the input, formatting and loops. Tony created the time conversion method and we both debugged the formatting and containers.
        We enjoyed working together, the project felt less stressful than previous classes labs. We were able to explain concepts and ideas on how
        code should be done. We cleared up errors on each others code and worked well together.
